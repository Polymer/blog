_In the recurring Community Highlights, we feature the latest neat projects and components being built with Polymer._

[GEâ€™s Predix](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.predix.io_&d=CwMFaQ&c=IV_clAzoPDE253xZdHuilRgztyh_RiV3wUrLrDQYWSI&r=9F6Dmst0NH2RGO9xMmnJKOe7JlNJuxJrlfva7kCPc3E&m=lMhDzKm4KW-DnORnk5NukOAhKd1aSZrcJ0eaHvqXrlc&s=fqkaPf3DIapZyaABDOWbu7JpCkG9SRTnkT07Xrn-vIk&e=><https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.predix.io_&d=CwMFaQ&c=IV_clAzoPDE253xZdHuilRgztyh_RiV3wUrLrDQYWSI&r=6IzGNk0NML0ha2ThIeehmg&m=JXx-B86n0-MEQMge5j-Hjt3a7R2RrK72eOmv2fTnFH4&s=s0eE4wQ3tFbQ-z2eIiUuUGGXEBCyH8yf0iooi-4t3RI&e=>) is a cloud-based platform-as-a-service built to support industrial internet of things applications - for analyzing and monitoring the massive stream of data coming from something like a windfarm or smart grid.  GE has been working with Polymer for over a year, and [recently announced Predix UI](https://www.predix.io/blog/article.html?article_id=1705) - a comprehensive set of Polymer-based web components that make it easy to assemble a high-quality applications on top of the Predix platform.

Predix UI uses Polymer to encapsulate and distribute a cohesively-designed set of elements for everything from charts and data tables to responsive layouts and color schemes. The declarative UI components make it possible to build powerful dashboards with minimal code, while also being useful for complex and highly-customized applications. Predix UI includes a Yeoman-based [component generator](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_PredixDev_generator-2Dpx-2Dcomp&d=CwMFaQ&c=IV_clAzoPDE253xZdHuilRgztyh_RiV3wUrLrDQYWSI&r=6IzGNk0NML0ha2ThIeehmg&m=tp3Bitzt16t1VIdu8EMWmsqiuR2Tm68BedBg0gw8oDE&s=YqNx5yCVhYpeRViUvrdE2_umD0_O3XGfnyFuasprAbs&e=) as well, to make it as frictionless as possible to create new UI components.

By being based on the web components standards with Polymer, the Predix UI components encapsulate their behavior for ultimate flexibility and modularity - they can be used to build applications from scratch, or to integrate with other web frameworks.

The Predix UI components are now available for companies to build applications on Predix - check them out at [https://predixdev.github.io/predix-ui/](https://predixdev.github.io/predix-ui/).
